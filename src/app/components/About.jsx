        My name is Mashrur Sakif Souherdo. I'm currently an A level student with
        an interest in computer science and machine learning. I worked on this
        project in my free time. This was a great way to make use of some of my
        preexisting skills in ML and data science and at the same time learning
        new things such as gathering data to create a custom dataset, learning
        how to set up a Github Actions pipeline for daily updates and much more.
        Overall this was a really fun project to make and it helped to improve
        my skillset as well
